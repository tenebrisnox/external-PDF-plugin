# external-PDF-plugin

**Embed external PDFs directly into your Obsidian notes with full viewer controls.**

This plugin lets you embed PDF files hosted online in your Obsidian notes without storing them in your vault. It also allows embedding from local files: either relative to the Obsidian vault or by absolute path (desktop only). It works on mobile devices, too.
